        """
        Purpose of this algorithm is to choose winners in a way that actually lowers
        their chances the more raffles they've won in the past.
        Conceptually, can think of it as giving out more raffle "tickets" to those that have not won as often.

        Each raffle win lowers your relative odds of winning by 25%.
        So someone who has won once is 0.75x as likely to win as someone who has never won.
        Someone who's won twice is 0.5625x (0.75^2) as likely as someone who has never won.
        And so on.

        Here's how it works.

        We start by fetching the past wins of everyone in the guild.
        Then, of the current raffle entrants, we start with the person who's won the most times.
        Going from that win count -> 0 we figure out the ticket distribution factor for each bucket of win counts.
        Then we figure out how many tickets they should get for each bucket based on that distribution factor.
        That then gives us the relative probability array that gets fed into random.choice

        Here's an example.

        Say we have the following entrants:
        8 people who've won 0 times
        5 people who have won 1 time
        2 people who have won 2 times
        1 person who has won 4 times

        Highest win count is 4 wins so we start there.
        That bucket awards 1 ticket and then we calculate the fewer-win bucket tickets:
        4 wins -> 1 ticket
        3 wins -> 4/3 (~1.3) tickets
        2 wins -> 16/9 (~1.8) tickets
        1 win -> 64/27 (~2.4) tickets
        0 wins -> 256/81 (~3.16) tickets

        This way: 4 wins gets 0.75x as many tickets as 3 wins,
        3 wins gets 0.75x as many tickets as 2 wins, and so on.

        Total tickets given out is the sum of each bucket's tickets the number of entrants:
        8 entrants * 256/81 tickets
        + 5 * 64/27
        + 2 * 16/9
        + 0 * 4/3
        + 1 * 1
        = ~41.7 tickets

        Now, the p-list values should all sum up to 1. So we treat those tickets as
        portions of a "single ticket" and give out those portions.
        We do that by taking the reciprocal, so 1/41.7 = 0.0239857862

        0.0239857862 now is the chance of winning if you were given one "ticket".
        Then we divvy out those tickets according to the number awarded per win bucket.

        So then we end with:
        8 people get 256/81 * 0.0239857862 = 0.07580692922 "tickets"
        5 people get 64/27 * 0.0239857862 = 0.05685519692 tickets
        2 people get 16/9 * 0.0239857862 = 0.04264139769 tickets
        1 person gets 1 * 0.0239857862 = 0.0239857862 tickets

        As a check, if we add all those up, it should equal 1.
        0.07580692922 * 8 + 0.05685519692 * 5 + 0.04264139769 * 2 + 0.0239857862 = 0.9999999999

        So then for our p-list, our resultant structure is:
        [0.07580692922, 0.07580692922, 0.07580692922, ..., 0.04264139769, 0.04264139769, 0.0239857862]

        And we sort the corresponding entrants list by their win counts ascending so the two lists line up.
        [0-wins entrant, 0-wins entrant, 0-wins entrant, ..., 2-wins entrant, 2-wins entrant, 4-wins entrant]

        Then we let numpy.random.choice work its magic.
